## Budget Analysis Using Python

* In this activity I create a Python Script for analyzing Financial records of a company. 
* I read data from a csv file "budget_data.csv"

 ...
 
 I use the data from the CSV file to:
 
 * Find the total number of months included in the dataset
 * Get the total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period
 * Calculate average of the changes in the Profit/Losses over the entire period
 * Find the greatest increase in profits(date and amount) over the entire period
 * The greatest decrease in Losses(date and amount) over the entire period
 
 
 I then export my analysis to a text file (analysis.txt) that contains my results.
